# Kaggle BBC News Competition Project
Hello, here you will find my Kaggle competition project.

## Objective
Review Non-negative Matrix Factorization, compare it with other supervised training models and participate in the competition to see how well models can predict the category of a news article.

## Notebook
You can find a detailed Jupyter Notebook within the repository which will guide you through the problem step by step and see the analysis I've done

## Closing Remarks
This is a personal project for the Colorado University MSc Data Science for the Unsupervised Learning methods course and hopefully you found this information useful.
